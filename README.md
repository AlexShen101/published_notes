# Notes
This is where I will publish some of my obsidian notes. I set this up using the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin, which you can view [on their github](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden?tab=readme-ov-file#-obsidian-digital-garden) or [on their site](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/).
