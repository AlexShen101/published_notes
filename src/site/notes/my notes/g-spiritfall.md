## hammer
one of the enchants let's you fully charge your launcher instantly every 2.5s. Pair that with the awakening enchant and you have 30% cooldown speed up permanently. 
The fully charged launcher breaks shields quickly, keeps enemies stunned for a while, deals extra damage from wall splats, and gives an easy solution for blightborn fights (down attack -> launcher or up attack -> up air -> launcher can both kill at very low percents)
so yeah get this enchant :>

if you don't have the full charge enchant though, hammer kinda feels bad ;-;

## dual hammers
never used

## bow
i have no clue what you do against shielded enemies :/

not great at reaching flying enemies, most of your air attacks are melee. very strong against ground enemies though
the launcher is kind of underwhelming but does give you ranged attacks
you can't throw enemies far but you can hit them with your launcher. maybe you can toss enemies into the launcher multiple times for good damage?

## crossbow

## link blades

## dual swords
feels very sweet spot dependent to deal damage. very fast and mobile, but doesn't have a launcher that throws enemies far (for wall splats or blightborn stages)
how do you deal with blightborn stages or shields?

## quad gauntlets
easy to string together attacks and the attacks cover a decently wide area, which lets you combo enemies
really struggles with shielded enemies just punching you back since you have to be close to hit them and can't stunlock them with combos, so you'll need something to solve that (shatter synergy, launcher enchant or down attack enchant )

for blightborn stages just beat the shit out of the enemy and then launcher them, or combo them offstage to kill

with some good blessings you can really melt enemies
- Navolik 
	- dash blessing lets you position quickly and attack faster, improving attack blessing
	- gaunlet groups and stunlocks enemies, so overcharge or ion loop can deal a ton of aoe damage
- Mishved
	- icicle blessing gets triggered really fast on down attack
	- shatter synergy solves shields

## big gauntlets
feels really good to use
throw simulator against unshielded enemies, making it really easy to string together items

easy access to wall splats, can attack quickly with down attack, easy to position with throws / throw cancels

## scythe
idk kinda mid
a lot of the enchants revolve around the scythe blade, so i just hit enemies and bounce the scythe blade around using the launcher

## drill spear
early game is awkward, but scales very hard with enchantments. The enchantments focus very heavily on throwing the drill, which pairs well with the shadow partner perk to spam projectiles.

really wants the magnetic pull enchantment to position and group enemies near you
the drill is very good at breaking shields and dealing damage through rapid hits

doesn't seem to have that many options against flying enemies
