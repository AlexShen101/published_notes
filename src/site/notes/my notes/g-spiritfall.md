very fun roguelite that has brawlhalla-style combat, a slay-the-spire like map, hades boons and roguelite progression systems 

## hammer
## dual hammers
## bow
## crossbow
## link blades

## dual swords
feels very sweet spot dependent to deal damage. very fast and mobile, but doesn't have a launcher that throws enemies far (for wall splats)
how do you deal with blightborn stages or shields?

best run: stray souls 0

## quad gauntlets
## big gauntlets
feels really good to use
throw simulator against unshielded enemies, making it really easy to string together items

easy access to wall splats, can attack quickly with down attack, easy to position with throws / throw cancels

best run: stray souls 9

## scythe
idk kinda mid
a lot of the enchants revolve around the scythe blade, so i just hit enemies and bounce the scythe blade around using the launcher

best run: stray souls 2

## drill spear
early game is awkward, but scales very hard with enchantments. The enchantments focus very heavily on throwing the drill, which pairs well with the shadow partner perk to spam projectiles.

really wants the magnetic pull enchantment to position and group enemies near you
the drill is very good at breaking shields and dealing damage through rapid hits

doesn't seem to have that many options against flying enemies

best run: stray souls 9
