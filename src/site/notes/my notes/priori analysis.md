## Priori Analysis
Priori analysis is a method of determining the running time and space requirements of an algorithm by analyzing its theoretical behavior. This analysis is performed with respect to a theoretical computer model, such as the [[random access machine model\|random access machine model]]. Since priori analysis is based on a theoretical algorithm, it is both language-independent and hardware-independent.

The goal of priori analysis is to determine a time function and a space function that represent how much time and space the algorithm uses with respect to an input size n.
