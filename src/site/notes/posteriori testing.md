## Posteriori Testing
Posteriori testing, on the other hand, involves running a program that implements the algorithm. This approach is language-dependent, as different programming languages may have different performance characteristics for the same operations. It is also hardware-dependent, as the hardware used to run the program affects its execution time and memory usage.

The purpose of posteriori testing is to determine the actual running time and memory usage of the algorithm in practice.
